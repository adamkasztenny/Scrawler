# Scrawler
Fake web crawler written in Scala. Written as an experiment in 2016, when I was still learning Scala. See #3 for a description of all the different things that need to be refactored in this project. 

The frontend, written in Play, can be found [here](https://github.com/slideon/Scrawler-frontend).
